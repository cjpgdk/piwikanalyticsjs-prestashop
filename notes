- Translations
Translation on PrestaShop version 1.5 do not work propperly with this module.
    it can be that this is just my setup using dev versions of PrestaShop.

* 1.5.0.1 > 1.5.0.3:  not working at all
* 1.5.0.5: works but not all translated strings are used, and 'validateconfiguration.tpl' is not translated
